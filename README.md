# Randall - A Fully Autonomous Treasure Seeking Robot :robot:

## The Competition
The **2022 ENPH 253 robotics competition** was designed to be the **most difficult** competition run over the 22-years the course has been established.  

Particularly, the **fully autonomous robots** were tasked to pick up and hold treasures, detect and avoid picking up magnetic bombs that looked exactly like treasures, overcome a chicken wire gap obstacle, follow black tape up a vertical 6-7‚Äù ramp, climb and descend onto a zipline, differentiate between a 1kHz and 10 kHz infrared beacon**, and be able to travel across a suspension bridge without the aid of black tape and signal processing. 

The following images illustrate the 3D layout of the competition surface as well as a diagram and legend of the surface details that helped the team to brainstorm strategies and specific functions required for Randall the Robot.
